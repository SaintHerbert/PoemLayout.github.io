  <h4>Departure</h4>
  <p>
        The Heated Season<br>
        I have been trying<br>
        Struck by lightning<br>
        That one morning<br>
        Ship was ready to set sail for the New World<br>
        Had booked passage<br>
        To sail on that boat<br><br>

<h4>Tuff Times</h4>
<p>
At first you think it's going to be ok<br>
And think all will be ok.<br>
But it creeps up on you with a thought.<br>
You start to sink in your thoughts.<br>
It raises your heart beat.<br>
The damn thing won't go away!<br>
It won’t let you be free.<br>
It won’t even let you sleep.<br>
You’ve got to get rid of it.<br>
We all have our ways.<br>
But they are not all the same.<br><br>
</p>

<h4>The Hat</h4>
<p>
Hanging, sitting, flying<br>
So many possibilities<br>
Something so simple<br>
In the wind, it flies away<br>
On the wall it hangs<br>
So many ways<br>
On a head it sits<br>
It keeps the hair calm<br>
It can represent anything<br>
Place, movement, sport<br>
So many possibilities<br>
colors, themes, and sizes<br>
So many<br>
It can be a collectors item<br>
It can be a souvenir<br>
It can be for a specific occasion<br>
So many<br><br>
</p>

<h4>The Relief</h4>
<p>
Finally, sleep<br>
The feeling of being relaxed.<br>
The feeling of sitting on the couch.<br>
Or the feeling of the end of a work shift.<br>
At night on your bed reading a book with a dimmed light.<br>
It's over.<br>
The feeling of being relieved.<br>
It makes you feel lightweight.<br>
Wanting to do things.<br>
Having a good night's sleep.<br>
Oh that great feeling.<br><br>
</p>

<h4>Happy</h4>
<p>
You always want to aim for this feeling.<br>
But sometimes it just won't come to you.<br>
And when you get it.<br>
Keep it.<br>
As long as you can.<br>
It lets you do things.<br>
It's the feeling when you’re opening a present.<br>
Or you’ve achieved something.<br>
It’s when you’ve had a good day.<br>
It's a good feeling.<br>
All you’ve got to do is keep it.<br><br>
